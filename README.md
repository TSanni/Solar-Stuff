# Solar Stuff

This project is an iOS application for astronomy enthusiasts. 
Information is shown about each major object in our solar system. Wth a nice looking UI and ease of use, 
users will find this application very useful for grabbing quick information about our 
little home in the universe.


## How It Was Made

This project was made using the following techniques:

- Xcode - IDE
- Swift - Programming Language
- 3D Assets - For planetary objects
- Included is a json file created by me to populate the UI with needed information
- Optimized to work with multiple iOS devices 
## Screenshots
A screenshot of the home screen for now. A gridview of each major object in the solar system.
